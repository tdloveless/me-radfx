* [NSREC 2018 Short Course](./NSREC_SC_Y2018.pdf)
	- Part I: A BRIEF HISTORY OF SPACE CLIMATOLOGY: FROM THE BIG BANG TO THE PRESENT
	- Dr. Mike Xapsos, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center
* [SPENVIS](https://www.spenvis.oma.be/intro.php)
	- SPENVIS is a web-based instrument intended to facilitate the use of models of the spatial environment, including:
		- coordinate generators
		- radiation sources and effects
		- magnetic field
		- Geant4 tools
		- Planetary environment
		- other
	- [Documentation](https://www.spenvis.oma.be/help/system/toc.html)
* [CRÉME96](https://creme.isde.vanderbilt.edu/)
	- CRÉME96 is a state-of-the-art tool for SEE rate prediction.
* [NSRL Stack-Up Calculator](https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/stackup/)
	- Excel-based calculator database so that users can explore how the beam energy, range of ions, and instantaneous energy transfer will behave based on a multi-layer transport approximation. 
	- Energy, range, dE/dx, and straggling information are available for all ions at NSRL and more across a selection of materials traditionally used by the heavy ion radiation field. 
	- Data are extracted from the [Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM/TRIM) free software by J. F. Ziegler](http://www.srim.org/)
