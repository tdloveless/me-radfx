# Syllabus for ENGR-E 399/599: Topics in Intelligent Systems Engineering, Radiation Effects and Reliability of Microelectronics
## Section: 13106

## Course Description: 
This course introduces the space radiation environment and its effects on microelectronics. The basic mechanisms of cumulative and transient radiation effects in state-of-the-art semiconductor devices are discussed, with special focus on the challenges of modeling, simulation, and measurement. Further, the implications of technology scaling are considered. Students will be exposed to industry-standard tools and techniques for estimating the reliability of microelectronics in extreme space environments.
