##  HW 4: Error Rate Modeling with CRÉME96
### This assignment uses [SRIM](http://www.srim.org/) and [CRÉME96](https://creme.isde.vanderbilt.edu/)
1. Using SRIM, determine the amount of aluminum shielding required to stop a 3300 MeV 129Xe ion. What about the same energy, but N, Ne, and Ar ions? What are the implications for shielding in general? *You may elect to use the [NSRL Stack-Up Calculator](https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/stackup/) to solve this problem.*
2. Roughly how much aluminum shielding would be required to reduce the heavy-ion-induced upset rate by an order of magnitude (rel. to 100 mils Al)? 3. Given a 64kbit memory array with an experimentally measured cross section of 2.3 x 10<sup>-9</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/bit, approximate the number of upsets expected over a 1-year mission. *Assume a sensitive volume of 200 nm x 200 nm x 500 nm.*4. Approximately what proportion of these upsets are due to ions with Z > 26? 5. Could we substitute one larger RPP instead of 64k small RPPs to get the same upset rate with CRÈME96? Why or why not?
