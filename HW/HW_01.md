##  HW 1: Pre-experience Reflection
### Your first entry into your lab journal/notebook:

After considering the course syllabus and reading the introductory slides, reflect on the course content. What problems or challenges are most intriguing to you? Assess your current knowledge and skills - what do you think will be helpful that you already know?  What new skills do you feel you need to acquire to help solve the challenge?
 
Start a lab notebook (an electronic notebook is ok). For your first journal/notebook entry, compose 1 or 2 informal paragraphs consisting of your thoughts on the course. Try to address the questions above.  In addition, what do you want to get out of this course?  What are your expectations?
 
### Deliverables: 
Upload a file to the Canvas course page containing your notebook entry or enter the text in the pro-vided box.
