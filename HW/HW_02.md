IUB ENGR-E-399/599 ME Radiation Effects and Reliability
##  HW 2: Modeling the Natural Space Radiation Environment
### This assignment uses [SPENVIS](https://www.spenvis.oma.be)
1. Using SPENVIS, model the following two orbits

||Polar LEO (POES, IRIDIUM)|HEO (Van Allen Probes, MMS)|
|--|--|--|
|Mission Duration|7 Years|2 years|
|Apogee|825 km|70000 km|
|Perigee|825 km|2500 km|
|Inclination|98.8 deg|28 deg|
|RAAN<sup>1</sup>|0 deg|0 deg|
|Argument of Perigee|0 deg|0 deg|
|True Anomaly|0 degs|0 deg|

<sup>1</sup>Right Ascension of the Ascending Node


* Assume a mission start date of Jan 1, 2026
* Use the following models:
	- Trapped Protons and Electronics: Standard AE-8 (solar max., 50% confidence level), AP-8 (solar min.)
	- CRÉME-96 solar particle model (Worst Day)
	- ESP-PHYCHIC solar particle model for total fluence (95% confidence level)
	- CRÉME-96 galactic cosmic ray model (solar min.)

2. Provide the following charts for each mission:
	* Trapped proton spectra
	* World maps of the trapped proton flux (for >10 MeV and >200 MeV)
	* Solar proton (Z=1) and heavy ion flux spectra for He (Z=2) and Fe (Z=26)
	* World maps of the 200 MeV solar proton attenuation factor
	* Mission average solar proton (Z=1) and heavy ion fluence spectra for He (Z=2) and Fe (Z=26) <sup>*</sup>_from solar particle mission fluences_
	* GCR spectra of protons (Z=1), He (Z=2), and Fe (Z=26)

3. Name three differences in each of these orbits, as compared to the in-class example of a notional Starlink LEO orbit
4. What is the integral flux of trapped protons of energy 1 MeV or greater?  What about for 200 MeV or greater?  
5. For the life of each of these missions, how does the total fluence of solar protons of 200 MeV or greater to compare to the Starlink LEO mission?  _Provide the expected ratio (fluence of desired mission)/fluence of Starlink LEO._
6. Which mission sees the highest flux of GCR of Z=2 and higher?  How about Z=26 and higher? Why?
